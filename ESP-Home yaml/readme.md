# Read [NS panel readme file](https://github.com/Hellis81/NS-panel/) for details about the code.

A lot of code is commented out in this file, that is Marc's code that I don't use.
I have left some of it there other parts have been deleted. 
Check out Marc's repository if something you need is missing.
